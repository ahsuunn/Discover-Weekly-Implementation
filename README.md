# Discover Weekly Implementation
This repository was created to fulfill the requirements of a Linear Algebra and Geometrics paper assignment to create a rough implmenetation on how the discover weekly Spotify implementation works. Although its not a full implementation it can give an understanding on how it works by using factorization.

# How To Run 
There is only 2 file in this repository that is implementation.py that contatin the implementation of factorization use for decomposing the user-song matrix. Then the test_case.py is to see if the implementation works by using a small dataset that contain the user-song matrix to then be decompose and see the result of.
